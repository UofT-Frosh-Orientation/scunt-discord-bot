# Scunt Discord Bot
## Setup
### Dependencies
* This discord bot uses python version 3
* The following libraries need to be installed for the bot to function, via pip
  * ```pip install discord```
  * ```pip install -U discord-py-slash-command```
  * ```pip install --upgrade Pillow```

### Creating the bot and credentials
1. Head to the discord developer portal and create a new application
    * https://discord.com/developers/applications
2.  On the ```Bot``` side page, enable intents 
    ![intents](/setup/Intents.png)
3. On the ```OAuth2``` side page, specify scopes corresponding to the scope required by the bot
    ![scope](/setup/Scopes.png)
    * If the administrator permission cannot be enabled (may need discord server owner permissions) then only check the respective permissions used by the bot
    * Copy the link and invite to created Scunt discord
4. (optional) On the ```Bot``` side page change the ```ICON``` and ```USERNAME```
5. On the ```Bot``` side page copy the ```TOKEN``` for the ```keys.json```
    * Create a ```keys.json``` file in the root of the repository using the template below
    * Add the ```MONGOURI``` to access the registration database, and add all server IDs where the bot would connect to in the ```guildIDs``` list
    * Get server ID by right clicking the server name, ```Copy ID```
    * ```SERVERID``` : int
    * ```TOKEN``` and ```MONGOURI``` : str
    * Ensure this is added to ```.gitignore```
    ```
    {
      "clientToken": "TOKEN",
      "guildIDs":[SERVERID, SERVERID],
      "mongoURI": "MONGOURI"
    }
    ```
### Setting up the Scunt Discord - Roles and Permissions
  * Add the following roles to the discord channel
    
    > Add: ```Team 1```, ```Team 2```, ```Team 3```, ```Team 4```, ```Team 5```, ```Team 6```, ```Team 7```, ```Team 8``` roles - As defined under ```teamRoles``` in ```constants.json```

    > Add: ```Logged In``` role - As defined under the ```loggedInRole``` in ```constants.json```

    > Create a ```#welcome``` text channel - As defined under the ```welcomeChannel``` in ```constants.json```

    All invites to the Scunt server should redirect to this text channel

  * Manage permissions manually in the Discord server settings, for access to specific team text/audio channels
  * Ensure the permission ```BOTNAME``` automatically created by discord is at the top of the hierarchy within the server... otherwise setting nickname and roles may return ```403 Forbidden (error code: 50013): Missing Permissions``` (see image below - ensure Bot role is above other roles otherwise it may not be able to assign the roles higher than itself)
  * ![hierarchy](/setup/Hierarchy.png)
  * Users with the ```Logged In``` role should not have access to type messages in the ```#welcome``` channel

## Usage

### Commands
  * ```/login <email>``` - Adds a user to the respective team roles within the server, sets the ```Logged In``` role, and sets nickname to preferred name and appends pronouns
  * ```/submit <number> <media-consent>``` - Submits via discord to the judges. The next message the user sends should be an attachment, and the bot will push this to the judges. If the user does not send another message within the timeout (30 seconds), an error message will be sent. User needs to reference the challenge number, and users info gets pushed along to judges as well (name, team, discord user etc.)
  * ```/submitlink <number> <link> <media-consent>``` - Submits a challenge to the judges with a link (This link can be user submitted via Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). User needs to reference the challenge number, and users info gets pushed along to judges as well (name, team, discord user etc.)
  * ```/status <number>``` - Retrieves and displays the status of a challenge. Can be submitted, not submitted, pending, or completed. When completed, judges comments, points earned etc. will return.
  * ```/help``` - DMs the user with commands the bot can do
  * ```/leaderboard``` - DMs the user with the current score of all the teams (in a nice generated image)
  * ```/view``` - DMs the user with the list of challenges, or provides a link to the website/pdf (supplied in ```constants.json```)

### Backend functionality
  * Accesses the registration database to retrieve information on a user after login to the discord. Retrieves users name, pronouns, Scunt team, etc.
  * Submissions and status updates on challenges
  * Challenges get forwarded to the judges automatically 

### Future Enhancements
  * the bot can only send DMs to people who have shared server DMs setting enabled in their profile (is there a way to check if this is the case, and send an error message in the server instead of failing)
  * donâ€™t allow double submissions from your team (or give warning before an upload that your team has already done that challenge number)
    * can send this message after the /submit command is run (before the bot waits for an upload)
  * allow multiple bot submissions (when the user uploads more than one discord attachment in one message, only the first one is taken... take all of them)
  * make media consent at login? and they can change it by running a command at any time (this avoids repetition every time someone wants to submit)
  * Implement automatic feedback functionality (below)
#### Automatic feedback functionality
  * Status updates - DMs the user the status command if the status of a challenge they submitted changes. Usually updated the submitter with info on points rewarded and judge comments.
  * Upload updates - DMs the user with information on the content they just submitted, as a confirmation
